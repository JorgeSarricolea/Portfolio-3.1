# Portfolio-3.1

Constant evolution, where each iteration marks a chapter in my journey that leads me to an improved version of myself.

Welcome to my digital space, where creativity and functionality merge in the world of web development. I am [Jorge Sarricolea](https://jorgesarricolea.com), a frontend developer and designer. This site is my digital canvas where I share my best projects.

If you like the design, feel free to 'git clone' my project and use it as a template. I also welcome suggestions to improve my own design; feel free to fork it and submit a pull request. ðŸ˜‰

Attached is the UI design of my portfolio: [UI Design Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/6M8nKNbHNqyuxXxUzeaNqF/Portfolio-3.0?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=dmItFXJi1wv14CKa-1)
